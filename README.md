# parasol-gtfs-philippines-selected-cities
The PARASOL system builds GTFS Static files of the public transport services and routes of selected cities, where the SafeTravelPH NGO team had deployments. Local government and LTFRB and other national government agencies can collaborate with us to build and publish on Google Maps these important local public transport system information. 

These are NOT OFFICIAL GTFS files of these cities.

Using the SafeTravelPH app and Parasol tools/programs, we identified the realtime tracks, travel/stopping times and distances, and stopping patterns. Then, we use AddTransit.com to easily validate syntactically the generated GTFS files.

If you are an public transport agency or operator, or a local government unit, feel free to reach out to us to collect routes and trips data, and co-create and validate your locality's GTFS datasets. You can email us at developer@safetravel.ph.
